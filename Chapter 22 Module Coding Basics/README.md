# Chapter 22: Module Coding Basics

In a word, Python modules are easy to create and easy to use, user-friendly.

## Module Creation

To define a module, simply edit some Python code into a text file, and then save it with '.py' extension; any such file is automatically considered a Python module. For instance, if you type the following `def` statement into a file called `module1.py` and import it, you are creating an object with one attribute-the name `printer`, which happens to be a reference to a fucntion object.

```python
def printer(x):
  print(x)
```
