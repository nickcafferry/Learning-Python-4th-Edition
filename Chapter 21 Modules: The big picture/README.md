Chapter 21 Modules: The Big Picture
-----------------------------------

Python module, the highest-level program organization unit, will be discussed in depth
in this chapter. In concrete terms, modules usually correspond to Python program files.
Modules are processed with two statements and one important function:

`import`:
      
      Lets a client (or importer) fetch a module as a whole
 
 `from`:
      
      Allows clients to fetch some particular units from a module
   
  `imp.reload`:
      
      Provides a way to reload a module without stopping Python
   
   Since Chapter 3 introduced module basics before and we've been using them ever since, 
   this chapter will expand on __core module concepts__
