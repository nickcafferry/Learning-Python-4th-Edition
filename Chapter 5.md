## Chapter 5---Numeric Types

A Complete inventory of Python's numeric toolbox includes:
* Integers and floating-point numbers
* Complex numbers
* Fixed-precision decimal numbers
* Rational fraction numbers
* Sets
* Booleans
* Unlimited integer precision
* A variety of numeric built-ins and modules

## Preview: Operator overloading and polymorphism

Python itself automatically overloads some operators to perform different actions depending on the type of built-in objects being processed.

The + operator performs addition when dealing with numbers but does concatenation when dealing with sequence objects such as strings and lists. This is usually called polymorphism.

## Variables and Basic Expressions

* Variables refer to objects and are created when assigned values, do need to be declared ahead of time

* When used in expression (normally this is done before being assigned), variables are replaced with their values
